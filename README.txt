***SDEtool_2019plus***

Latest iteration of this online tool I developed to compute the financial viability of solar panel projects with SDE+ subsidies. This tool visualizes expected costs, revenues and earn-back time as well.

* Investment costs
* Operational costs
* Energy savings
* Estimated subsidies
* Earn-back time
* Expected degeneration

Production project, using Javascript and ChartJS. First project where I implemented object-oriented programming.
